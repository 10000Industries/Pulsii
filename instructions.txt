You are creating a fully minimal, clean, mathematically precise version of an interactive app called **Pulse**.

The app must have:
- A **pure black background** (#000000)
- A **continuous colour wheel selector** (simple hue slider is fine)
- Tap/click anywhere to create a **pulse ripple** at that coordinate
- The pulse is a **perfect expanding circle**, not stylized or “artistic”
- The colour of the pulse is the chosen colour
- Pulses fade smoothly over time (alpha fade)
- Many pulses may overlap; colours should blend additively
- The user sees pulses from every connected user in real time
- Real-time syncing will be done via a simple WebSocket server

The entire front-end must be:
- Minimalist (no UI chrome, no buttons except colour selector)
- One full-screen canvas
- No borders, no shadows, no logos
- 60fps or as close as the browser can achieve

Folder structure to generate:

/index.html
  - imports style.css and script.js

/style.css
  - canvas fills screen
  - colour picker in bottom-left corner
  - minimal styling, no borders, no shadows

/script.js
  - draw a full-window HTML canvas
  - track pulses {x, y, hue, radius, alpha}
  - handle additive colour mixing on canvas
  - use requestAnimationFrame for animation loop
  - connect to a WebSocket server at ws://localhost:8080
  - on receiving a pulse, add it to local pulses
  - on user click/tap: create a pulse and send it to server

/server.js
  - Node WebSocket server using 'ws'
  - broadcasts any received pulse to all connected clients

Also include:

package.json
  - with dependencies: ws, express
  - with scripts: "start" for the server, "serve" for the client

After generating all files, ensure:
- The app loads in a browser by opening index.html
- The server runs with:  node server.js
- The pulses appear, animate, fade, and sync correctly
- All code is heavily commented for readability

Finally:
Explain any required setup steps to run the app locally.
Do NOT include anything unnecessary.
Keep everything minimal and clean.
